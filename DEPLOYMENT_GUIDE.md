# Akhilesh Exports - Garment Craft Website Deployment Guide

## ✅ Website Successfully Converted to Independent Hosting

The website has been successfully converted to run independently without any external dependencies on Lovable or other services.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🌐 Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Using Built-in Node.js Server
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The server will run at `http://localhost:5000`

### Option 2: Static File Hosting (Recommended)
The built files in the `dist` folder can be deployed to any static hosting service:

**Supported Platforms:**
- **Netlify** (already configured with netlify.toml)
- **Vercel**
- **GitHub Pages**
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**
- **Azure Static Web Apps**
- **Firebase Hosting**
- **Any web server (nginx, Apache)**

### Option 3: Traditional Web Server
Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server. The build includes:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `assets/` - Compiled CSS, JS, and optimized images
- All necessary files for client-side routing

## 📁 Project Structure
```
├── src/              # Source code
├── dist/             # Built files (for deployment)
├── public/           # Static assets
├── package.json      # Dependencies and scripts
├── server.js         # Production server (optional)
├── vite.config.ts    # Vite configuration
└── netlify.toml      # Netlify deployment config
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for environment-specific settings (optional):
```env
VITE_API_URL=your_api_url_here
```

### Build Configuration
The project uses Vite for building. Key configurations:
- **Base Path**: Set `base` in `vite.config.ts` for subdirectory deployments
- **Output Directory**: Built files go to `dist/`
- **Asset Handling**: Images and assets are optimized during build

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Pages
1. Create component in `src/pages/`
2. Add route in `src/App.tsx`
3. Update navigation in relevant components

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom CSS in `src/index.css`
- Component-specific styles with CSS modules

### Images and Assets
- Place static assets in `public/`
- Dynamic images in `src/assets/`
- Images are optimized during build process

## 📊 Performance
- **Bundle Size**: ~464kB (JS) + ~73kB (CSS) + images
- **Lighthouse Score**: Optimized for performance
- **SEO Ready**: Proper meta tags and structure

## 🔒 Security
- No backend dependencies in production build
- Static files only
- HTTPS ready

## 📞 Support
For deployment issues, check:
1. All build dependencies are installed
2. Node.js version compatibility (14+ recommended)
3. File permissions on server

## 🔄 Updates
To update the website:
1. Make changes in `src/` directory
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Deploy new `dist/` folder contents
